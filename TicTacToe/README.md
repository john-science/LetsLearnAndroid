# A simple Tic-Tac-Tao Game

This app was created following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apDL78MFR3o&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuA0ykzsHIdQUC5yKxArSM2V), then I made a bunch of tweaks and added an AI to play against.


## The Stack

Here's the stack I used for this little experiment:

* Ubuntu 18.04 (64-bit)
* Android Studio 4.0.1
* Java v11.0.8
* Gradle v6.1.1
* SQLite vXXX
