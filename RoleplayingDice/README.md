# Example Android Application - 2020

> This will be a simple D&D Dice app.

The whole goal of this app is to re-familiarize myself with Android as it stands in 2020. And it's a nice chance to play with Java v11.


## The Stack

Here's the stack I used for this little experiment:

* Ubuntu 18.04 (64-bit)
* Android Studio 4.0.1
* Java v11.0.8
* Gradle v6.1.1
