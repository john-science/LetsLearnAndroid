# Let's Learn Android

This repo is just a series of little Android apps I'm using to re-learn the Android platform and see what's new with Android Studio. I am live-coding these and sharing in case someone else finds them interesting, or even just useful templates for their own work.

## Apps

1. [Roleplaying Dice](RoleplayingDice/) - Calculator-like tool for gamers to roll various kinds of dice
2. [Custom List Example](CustomListExample/) - Learning to use custom layouts and display images (of Cthulhu)
3. [SQLite Demo](SQLiteDemo/) - Learning to use Android's built-in SQLite DB tooling
4. [Tic-Tac-Toe](TicTacToe/) - A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game
5. [Native C++ App](NativeCPPApp/) - A simple example of including C++ code in an Android App.
6. [Chess Cheater](ChessCheater/) - A trap app to punish people who cheat at chess online.
