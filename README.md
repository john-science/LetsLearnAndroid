# Let's Learn Android

This repo is just a series of little Android apps I'm using to re-learn the Android platform and see what's new with Android Studio. I am live-coding these and sharing in case someone else finds them interesting, or even just useful templates for their own work.

## Apps

1. [Dungeons & Dragons Dice](RoleplayingDice/README.md)

## The Stack

Here's the stack I am using for this repo:

    Ubuntu 18.04 (64-bit)
    Android Studio 4.0.1
    Java v11.0.8
    Gradle v6.1.1
