# Example Android Application - 2020

> This will be a simple D&D Dice app.

The whole goal of this app is to re-familiarize myself with Android. It's been a while since I played with it, so it's probably time to refresh my take on all the little changes to the Android Studio IDE, Java, and the Android JDK.


## The Stack

Here's the stack I used for this little experiment:

* Ubuntu 18.04 (64-bit)
* Android Studio 4.0.1
* Java v11.0.8
* Gradle v6.1.1
