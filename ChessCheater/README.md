# ChessCheater

> ChessCheater is an app designed to punish people who cheat in chess.

It is, apparently, super common in online play for people to look up what move the computer says will be the best move
to play next.

This app will usually tell people to play an okay-ish move. Not the best one possible, but one of the top 5. But then
sometimes it will tell people to make insidiously bad moves. It will do this particularly if the move might *look* good
to someone that's no paying attension.

The tricky part will be how to diseminate information about this app to the honest chess community. That way, when
a cheater asks for tools on forums, honest players can direct them here. The social engineering will definitely be the
hardest part of this app.


## DroidFish Rocks

This app is basically just me mangling the pre-existing [DroidFish](https://github.com/peterosterlund2/droidfish) repo.
Peter Osterlund is really to credit for making an Android wrap of the C++ StockFish engine available to the public.
